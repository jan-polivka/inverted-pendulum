# inverted-pendulum
Inverted Pendulum on a TIva Launchpad (ARM Cortex M4) from the ground up.

The project is very much work in progress. The number one goal is to get it working. The second goal is to learn more about the ARM platform. Some UART register-based functions are done and can be provided on request.
